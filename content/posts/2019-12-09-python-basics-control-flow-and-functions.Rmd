#Run the following code in order to use python on RStudio
```{r setup, include=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(reticulate)
use_python("/usr/bin/python")
```

```{python}
x = 'hello world'
print(x)
```

#Load the data faithful. Examine the type of the object. Find the minimum and maximum values of the variables eruptions and waiting.
```{python}
faithful=r.faithful 
import pandas as pd
faithful=pd.read_csv("https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/datasets/faithful.csv")

x=faithful
type(x)
```


```{python}
faithful.head()
```

```{python}
faithful.eruptions.max() #max for eruptions
```

```{python}
faithful.eruptions.min() #min for eruptions
```

```{python}
faithful.waiting.max() #max for waiting
```

```{python}
faithful.waiting.min() #min for waiting
```

#Import numpy and use functions from it to compute the mean, median, and variance for each variable. Compute the correlation between the two variables using corrcoef (it will return a matrix). Access individual variables in a dataframe using the . operator (e.g., faithful.eruptions).
```{python}
import numpy as np

np.mean(faithful['eruptions'])
```
