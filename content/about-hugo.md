Hi there! My name is Min Jo Lee or Andrew; either works! I study ***Computational Biology*** and ***Business Healthcare*** at **the University of Texas at Austin**. I'm currently learning how to incorporate knowledge and skills of ***Data Science*** into ***Healthcare*** and ***Medicine***. Other than academic work, I play or watch soccer and enjoy cooking. Sometimes I write film reviews.
