***Abstract***

Human rhinovirus is a virus that causes common cold illnesses. Rhinovirus C (RV-C), one of the three genetically distinct groups of rhinovirus, is mainly responsible for deadly illnesses such as asthma. On a molecular level, the expression of human protein Cadherin-related facility member (CDHR3), more specifically, its structural domain 1 and 2 are thought to be the binding sites for RV-C that is then introduced in our body. To determine the protein structure and its mechanism, purification can be done. However, CDHR3 remains in the cell debris due to its insolubility, preventing it from being purified. Furthermore, CDHR3 does not only bind to RV-C and may have different functions. Therefore, site-directed mutagenesis was performed to create mutants of the human receptor protein for Rhinovirus type 3 protein CDHR3, to further express and purify to develop antibodies against the receptor to inhibit Rhinovirus infection. 

***Rhinovirus-C: The Most Frequent Causes of Respiratory Tract Infections***

Human Rhinoviruses are small, nonenveloped, single-stranded, RNA viruses that are classified within the genus Enterovirus of the eight genera belonging to the family Picornaviridae. They have been associated only with mild upper respiratory tract infections. However, recent studies have shown that they are associated with more severe diseases such as pneumonia—especially in infants and the elderly.

***Rhinovirus-C (RV-C) binds to Cadherin-related family member 3 (CDHR3)***

The expression of CDHR3, a human protein found in lung tissues, is proposed to be accountable for the binding of RV-C and its replication in human cells. The structure of CDHR3 consists of six domains to two of which the virus binds while the exact conformation is still unknown. During the protein purification process, CDHR3 remains in the cell debris as it is transmembrane protein and insoluble.

***No Treatment Exists for Rhinovirus-C Infection***

* Respiratory viruses remain a leading cause of childhood disease.
* Primary target host cell in the airways remains unknown.
* Expression of human cadherin-related family member 3 in airway epithelial cells is positively correlated with RV-C binding and replication

`Goal of Research` is to devlop an inhibitory mechanism of RV-C binding to CDHR3 (antibody that binds to CDHR3).

However, there are some `current issues of research`:
* CDHR3 is a membrane receptor protein.
* CDHR3 remains insoluble making unable to purify protein.

Therefore, `specific aims` to resolve these issues are:
1. To introduce point-mutation on a target site via site-directed mutagenesis.
2. To create truncation mutant via Gibson Assembly.

***Creating Truncation Mutant via Gibson Assembly***

***Results***

Site-directed mutagenesis was successfully introduced and confirmed through sequencing results as isoleucine (ATA) was mutated into serine (TCA). The DNA sequence trace showed that N amino acid was C with blue fluorescent dye.
However, Gibson Assembly did not work, which might have caused from not suitable vectors; therefore, different methods of Gibson Assembly should be done. 

***Future Directions***
* Restart from creating truncation mutants.
* To express and purify protein needed for development of antibody.
* Examine its crystal structure for antibody development.
