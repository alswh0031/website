      <description>#Run the following code in order to use python on RStudio
x = &amp;#39;hello world&amp;#39; print(x) ## hello world #The following presents with several real-world strings. The task is to use regular expressions in python to match (and return) the requested parts in each
#Using re.findall(), match all numbers and pull them from the following string (string1).
import re string1=&amp;quot;We have to extract these numbers 12, 47, 48 The integers numbers are also interesting: 189 2036 314\&amp;#39;,\&amp;#39; is a separator, so please extract these numbers 125,789,1450 and also these 564,90456 We like to offer you 7890$ per month in order to complete this task.</description>

The second dataset is about individual‚Äôs medical cost charged by healthcare insurance companies. As I‚Äôm interested in healthcare and medicine, I‚Äôd like to know if there is any interesting relationship between student‚Äôs performance and the cost of insurance with consideration of factors like economic, personal, and social.</description>

      <description>Abstract
Human rhinovirus is a virus that causes common cold illnesses. Rhinovirus C (RV-C), one of the three genetically distinct groups of rhinovirus, is mainly responsible for deadly illnesses such as asthma. On a molecular level, the expression of human protein Cadherin-related facility member (CDHR3), more specifically, its structural domain 1 and 2 are thought to be the binding sites for RV-C that is then introduced in our body. To determine the protein structure and its mechanism, purification can be done.</description>
