The second dataset is about individual&#39;s medical cost charged by healthcare insurance companies. As I&#39;m interested in healthcare and medicine, I&#39;d like to know if there is any interesting relationship between student&#39;s performance and the cost of insurance with consideration of factors like economic, personal, and social.</description>

      <description>Abstract
Human rhinovirus is a virus that causes common cold illnesses. Rhinovirus C (RV-C), one of the three genetically distinct groups of rhinovirus, is mainly responsible for deadly illnesses such as asthma. On a molecular level, the expression of human protein Cadherin-related facility member (CDHR3), more specifically, its structural domain 1 and 2 are thought to be the binding sites for RV-C that is then introduced in our body. To determine the protein structure and its mechanism, purification can be done.</description>
