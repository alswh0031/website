##0 Introduction getwd() ## [1] &amp;quot;/Users/andrewminjolee/Desktop/website3/content/Projects&amp;quot; performance&amp;lt;-read.csv(&amp;quot;exam.csv&amp;quot;,TRUE,&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;) medicalcost&amp;lt;-read.csv(&amp;quot;insurance.csv&amp;quot;,TRUE,&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;) The first dataset is about student performance in three different(subjects) exams along with parental education level and completion of test preparation. The second dataset is about individual’s medical cost charged by healthcare insurance companies. As I’m interested in healthcare and medicine, I’d like to know if there is any interesting relationship between student’s performance and the cost of insurance with consideration of factors like economic, personal, and social.</description>

      <description>Abstract
Human rhinovirus is a virus that causes common cold illnesses. Rhinovirus C (RV-C), one of the three genetically distinct groups of rhinovirus, is mainly responsible for deadly illnesses such as asthma. On a molecular level, the expression of human protein Cadherin-related facility member (CDHR3), more specifically, its structural domain 1 and 2 are thought to be the binding sites for RV-C that is then introduced in our body. To determine the protein structure and its mechanism, purification can be done.</description>
